Robust scientific inference and evidence-based decision making require data that inform the underlying question or objective. Accordingly, study design and data collection must be carefully planned and question-specific. The higher the stakes, the greater the required confidence. Confidence in results is achieved through:

1.  ***appropriate experimental design***,

2.  ***proper data analysis***, and

3.  ***effective and honest visualization***.

At EnviroStats Solutions, we provide expert advice and consultation through data analysis, visualization, and interpretation to anyone operating in the environmental space. With our long-standing experience in applied and fundamental research, we are ideally positioned to support you in all aspects of evidence-based decision making starting from experimental design to final recommendations.
